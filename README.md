# Website_Traffic_Prediction-and-Comparing-Different-Models
This project analyzes website traffic data to predict the Conversion Rate using multiple regression techniques. The dataset includes key features related to user behavior and traffic metrics. The goal is to compare the performance of Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models to identify the best-fitting model for predicting conversion rates.

Dataset Details

The dataset contains the following features:

Independent Features (Predictors):

Session Duration: Total time spent by a user on the website during a session.

Time on Page: Duration spent on a specific page.

Bounce Rate: Percentage of users who leave the website after viewing only one page.

Page Views: Number of pages viewed during a session.

Previous Visits: Number of times the user visited the website previously.

Dependent Variable (Target):

Conversion Rate: The percentage of users who complete a desired action (e.g., purchase, sign-up).

Objective

Build and evaluate predictive models to estimate Conversion Rate.

Compare the performance of Multiple Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression to determine the best model.

Methodology

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values and ensured data cleanliness.

Normalized or standardized features to improve model performance.

Model Development:

Implemented Multiple Linear Regression to assess the linear relationship between features and the target variable.

Enhanced the model by introducing Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships.

Performance Metrics:

Evaluated models using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

R-squared (R²)

Adjusted R-squared

Results and Findings

Model Comparison

Multiple Linear Regression:

R² Score: 12.25%

Observed low predictive accuracy, indicating the need for a more complex model.

Polynomial Regression:

R² Score: 32.5%

Improved performance by capturing non-linear relationships between predictors and the target variable.

Key Insights:

Polynomial Regression significantly outperformed Multiple Linear Regression, demonstrating the importance of accounting for non-linear patterns in the data.

The relationship between features like Session Duration and Conversion Rate appears non-linear, which was better modeled by polynomial terms.

Conclusion

Polynomial Regression is the recommended model for predicting conversion rates based on the given dataset, as it captures complex relationships more effectively.

Further exploration of feature engineering and additional predictors could improve model accuracy.
